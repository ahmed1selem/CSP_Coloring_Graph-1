# CSP_Coloring_Graph


# description
- we have a  map  of australia ! 
- ![Alt text](/assets/map.png)
- we need to color each part of the map with different color !
- this simple CSP problem has :
1. variables (6 parts of map)
2. domain of color values (three colors )
3. constraints (NO two adjacent parts have the same colors )!

# solution 
- index.py is an object of the solver.py CLass
- read the commented code ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
